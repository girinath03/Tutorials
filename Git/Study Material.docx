Github Tutorial.

VS-Code – Github:
Git Clone comment will clone the respositories  into local tools ( VS ) .
.git file will be the bridge act to the github apps and VS tools. ( it will be hidden ).
Moving the working folder to copy folder .
Git  add text2.txt ( this will be added to the working folder ) .
Untracked to status verified.
But not yet to the github  app folder.
Git commit -m “text2.txt added”
Then push to clone folder to app folder:
git push orgin(which is link copied main brach) main

Modifying / Deleting the value in the particular txt file will be same.


Github to VS-Code :
If any folder ceated in  the github change will be come to VS code :
git pull


Creating New Folder adding file then pushing to the github:
Nee to change the folder into git folder so :
git init ( will make a empty repositories the create two working places like cloned places and working places)

Over all untracked file to staging area :
git  add .(dot)
If u need to check ( git status)
This will make all the untracked file to staging area then need to commit .
Git commit -m “created all the html and css file.

Then need to push the folder into github:
But it got some errors so go to github and make a new repositories and copy the code :
Then git remote add orgin ( link of new repositories)
Then it will be connected to the orgin .

Git brach comment will show the brach.
Need to verify the brach git always has master brach.
Else need to change the branch name like 
git brach -M main

then comment to push 
git push orgin main


Branch switching and creating :
Git brach -a will show all the braches .
if you need any other braches in this same braches then create the brach in github and then pull comment in VS.

Switching the brach one to another brach then use comment git chechkout <brach_name>.
If u make changes any sub braches then it wil not be shown in main braches.
So check difference use comment git diff <brach_name_created>.

Merging the created brach to main brach use comment :
git merge <brach_name_created>.
Then git push orgin main.
// Then new updated main braches will be shown in the github.


PULL-REQUEST ( CANT USE IN COMMENT PROMPT)
We cant access the main repositories at the time notifying the main braches that we make a changes in new braches check and add to the main braches .
Then it will be verified by the bosses and it will added to the main braches.
PULL request option will be in github apps . the write the description the give pull request.
Then boss will notifying the pull request message after verifying the request then it will change the main files. 


CONFLICTS :
If any file can be modifed by two members then git will confuse what would I do first .
This conflict will be resolve by the boss . he Enter the resolve changes and then he enter what he needs then it will be merged with the main braches.

If you need to pull from another brache use comment git pull origin main
